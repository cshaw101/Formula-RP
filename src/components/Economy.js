        Money makes the worldâ€”and our leagueâ€”go round! The economy is a core
        part of our F1 roleplaying experience, creating an added layer of
        strategy and competition for every role. Managing your finances wisely
        could make the difference between victory and defeat. Hereâ€™s how it
        works:
