        The weather in our league is just like real lifeâ€”unpredictable! While we have a dedicated Weather Channel in the Discord for all race-related forecasts, keep in mind that these predictions are not always perfect. Races can be impacted by sudden changes, making strategy decisions tricky for teams.

        Teams with enough funds can purchase an Enhanced Weather Monitor to get more accurate and reliable weather predictions. This will help your team make better-informed decisions about tire choices and race strategy.
